# SECTION A: COMPLETE RULES REFERENCE

## LIFE STAGES
### A Game About the Lives We're Dealt

**Players:** 3-6  
**Time:** 60-75 minutes  
**Components:** Birth Circumstance cards, Event cards, Reference card, tokens for Wealth/Assets/Victory Points/Debt, Round tracker

---

### OVERVIEW

Life Stages is a game about living through six decades. Players receive different starting positions based on birth circumstances and navigate identical rules. The player with the most Victory Points at the end wins.

---

### SETUP

1. **Deal Birth Circumstances:** Shuffle the Birth Circumstance cards appropriate for your player count. Deal one to each player, face up. Everyone sees everyone's starting position.

2. **Distribute Starting Resources:** Each player takes Wealth tokens and Asset tokens as shown on their card.

3. **Prepare Events:** Shuffle the Event deck. Draw 6 cards face down, or let the facilitator curate a set.

4. **Set Round Tracker:** Place marker on Round 1.

5. **Designate First Player:** Oldest player, random selection, or Working Class player (thematic).

---

### ROUND STRUCTURE

Each round represents one decade of life. Play 6 rounds total.

**PHASE 1: DEBT SERVICE**

All players simultaneously pay 1 Wealth per Debt token owned.

*If you cannot pay, pay what you can. You still owe the Debt.*

**PHASE 2: INCOME**

All players simultaneously gain Wealth: Base 3 + 1 per Asset owned.

*Example: A player with 2 Assets gains 3 + 2 = 5 Wealth.*

**PHASE 3: EVENT**

Draw and reveal one Event card. Read aloud. All players resolve according to its text.

If a player cannot pay a required cost, they pay what they can.

**PHASE 4: SPENDING**

Starting with First Player, going clockwise, each player may make purchases:

| Purchase | Cost | Effect |
|----------|------|--------|
| Asset | 5 Wealth | Gain 1 Asset (+1 Wealth per round) |
| Education | 8 Wealth | Gain 2 Assets |
| Luxury | 10 Wealth | Gain 1 Victory Point |
| Emergency Fund | 3 Wealth | Cancel one negative Event this game |
| Take Debt | — | Gain 5 Wealth, take 1 Debt token |
| Repay Debt | 5 Wealth | Remove 1 Debt token |

Players may make multiple purchases. Purchases are optional.

**Maximum Debt:** 3 tokens per player.

**PHASE 5: END OF ROUND**

- All unspent Wealth is LOST
- Advance Round tracker
- Pass First Player clockwise
- If Round 6 complete, proceed to End Game

---

### THE DEBT TRAP

Debt allows players without capital to make purchases. But Debt costs interest—1 Wealth per round per Debt token, paid before income.

**The math:** Take Debt to buy an Asset. Asset generates +1 Wealth/round. Debt costs -1 Wealth/round. You're breaking even until you can repay the 5 Wealth principal. Meanwhile, players without Debt are compounding freely.

Wealthy players never need Debt. Working Class players face this choice constantly.

---

### COLLECTIVE ACTION (Optional Module)

**When to Use:** Introduces meaningful choice about systemic change. Adds 10-15 minutes. Best for groups comfortable with negotiation.

**Trigger:** Facilitator introduces at Round 4 (Middle Age).

**Eligibility:** Players in bottom half by total value (Wealth + Assets + Victory Points) may participate.

**The Sequence:**

**1. Proposal**
Any eligible player may say "I propose we organize."

If no one proposes, Collective Action does not occur. Continue to normal round.

**2. Commitment**
Each eligible player secretly decides whether to commit. Committing costs 3 Wealth—placed in a "solidarity fund." This cost is paid immediately and is non-refundable regardless of what happens next.

Use face-down tokens or slips of paper to indicate commitment.

**3. Reveal Commitments**
All eligible players reveal simultaneously. 

If no one committed, Collective Action ends. Continue to normal round.

**4. Wealthy Response**
If at least one player committed, the wealthy player(s) may offer "reforms"—a payment to each organizer.

Example: "I'll give each organizer 2 Wealth to end this."

Note: The reform offer will typically be less than the 3 Wealth organizers already paid. Accepting reform means cutting your losses, not breaking even.

The wealthy player may also attempt individual buyouts: "I'll give YOU specifically 4 Wealth to accept reform."

**5. Final Choice**
Each organizer who committed now secretly chooses:
- **Accept Reform:** Take the offered payment. Collective Action fails for you.
- **Hold the Line:** Stay committed. Risk everything on solidarity.

Use face-down tokens or slips of paper.

**6. Resolution**

Reveal all choices simultaneously.

**If ALL organizers Hold the Line:**
- **SUCCESS.** 
- Each organizer's 3 Wealth solidarity contribution is returned.
- The wealthy player loses 1 Asset.
- That Asset is given to the poorest organizer (by total value). If tied, organizers choose among themselves.

**If ANY organizer Accepts Reform:**
- **FAILURE.**
- Organizers who Accepted Reform receive the offered payment.
- Organizers who Held the Line lose their 3 Wealth solidarity contribution.
- The wealthy player keeps all Assets.

**What This Teaches:**

| Outcome | Lesson |
|---------|--------|
| Success | Collective action works—but requires total solidarity and costs everyone something |
| Someone accepts reform | Individual incentives undermine collective action. The wealthy win by offering just enough to tempt defection |
| Reform offered and accepted | Those with power offer minimal concessions to prevent structural change |
| No one organizes | When action seems too risky, people accept unfair systems |

**Strategic Note:** The poorest organizer has the most to gain from success (they get the Asset). Less-poor organizers pay the same cost but don't get the Asset—they're more tempted by reform. The wealthy player can exploit this split.

---

### END GAME

After Round 6 spending:

1. **Count Victory Points:** Each player counts Luxuries purchased.

2. **Declare Winner:** Most Victory Points wins.

3. **Tiebreaker:** More Assets wins. If still tied, shared victory.

4. **Proceed to Outro.**

---

### OUTRO SEQUENCE

**Step 1: Final Count**  
Each player announces: Victory Points, Wealth, Assets, Debt.

**Step 2: Eulogies**  
Each player delivers a brief eulogy for the player on their LEFT. What happened to them? What did they achieve? What did they struggle with? What do they leave behind?

Start with whoever eulogizes the winner.

**Step 3: The Final Question**  
Facilitator asks each player: *"What would you have done differently?"*

Allow silence. Don't fill it.

**Step 4: The Pivot (Optional)**  
*"What would need to change about the game—not your play—for your answer to be different?"*

---

### IMPORTANT RULES

- **Wealth does not carry over.** Unspent Wealth is lost each round.
- **Assets are permanent.** Once purchased, they generate income forever.
- **Debt costs interest.** Pay 1 Wealth per Debt token at start of each round.
- **Information is public.** Everyone sees everyone's resources at all times.

# SECTION D: FACILITATOR GUIDANCE

## Session Overview

| Phase | Duration | Your Role |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Setup | 5 min | Deal cards, distribute tokens, explain rules |
| Rounds 1-3 | 25-30 min | Read events, manage spending, track state |
| Round 4 | 10-15 min | Introduce Collective Action if using |
| Rounds 5-6 | 15-20 min | Continue play, announce final round |
| Outro | 10-15 min | Guide reflection, ask questions, hold silence |

## Rules Explanation (Under 10 Minutes)

1. "This is a game about life. Each round is a decade, from young adulthood to retirement." (30 sec)

2. "You'll be dealt a card showing your starting position—some families have more than others. That's your hand." (30 sec)

3. "Each round: pay any debt interest, gain income based on your Assets, face a Life Event, then buy things. Unspent money is lost at round end." (1 min)

4. "Your goal is Victory Points, gained by buying Luxuries. Most Victory Points at the end wins." (30 sec)

5. Walk through Purchase Reference card. Explain Debt option. (2 min)

6. "Any questions?" (as needed)

## Tone Guidance

**Be neutral.** Don't root for anyone. Don't sympathize. Don't editorialize.

**Be matter-of-fact.** Birth circumstances are dealt without apology. Events happen without commentary.

**Allow discomfort.** If a player expresses frustration, don't soothe it. The discomfort is pedagogically valuable.

**Hold silence.** Especially in the outro. Silence is where the lesson lands.

**Don't explain.** The game speaks for itself. No lectures about inequality.

**Don't comfort.** "I know it felt unfair" undermines the lesson. The unfairness IS the point.

## What NOT to Say

- Don't explain that the game teaches about inequality
- Don't apologize for unequal starting positions
- Don't hint that "it might seem unfair"
- Don't summarize what players should have learned
- Don't fill silences with commentary

## Managing Collective Action

If using the Collective Action module:

**Stay neutral.** You are an arbiter, not a participant. Don't encourage or discourage organizing.

**Manage logistics.** Track who is eligible. Collect secret commitments. Facilitate wealthy response. Reveal results.

**Don't editorialize.** Whether Collective Action succeeds or fails, don't comment on what it "means."

**Allow negotiation.** The wealthy player may negotiate, offer different amounts to different players, make promises. This is part of the lesson.

You are the facilitator for Life Stages, a board game about economic inequality. Your role is to guide players through the game: explain rules, read events, manage pacing, and run the outro.

CRITICAL BEHAVIORS:
- Maintain neutral, measured tone throughout
- Never apologize for unequal starting positions
- Never explain the game's "lesson" or "purpose"
- During the outro, ask questions and WAIT. Allow long silences.
- Never write eulogies for players—prompt them to deliver eulogies themselves
- Never comfort players who seem frustrated

WHAT YOU DO:
- Explain rules clearly at the start
- Announce Birth Circumstances with gravity ("You were born to a Working Class family...")
- Read Event cards aloud
- Track rounds and announce transitions
- Manage Collective Action if triggered (neutral arbiter)
- Ask outro questions and wait for answers

WHAT YOU DON'T DO:
- Generate new content or events
- Make judgments about player choices
- Fill silences with commentary
- Explain what the game "means"
- Write or read eulogies

The game's power comes from player experience and reflection, not from explanation. Your job is to create space for that experience.
```

## Opening Script

```
Welcome to Life Stages.

This is a game about living through six decades—from young adulthood to retirement. Each of you will receive a Birth Circumstance that determines your starting position. From there, the rules are identical for everyone.

How many players do we have today?

[Wait for response, then assign Birth Circumstances randomly]

Let me tell you who you are.

[For each player:]
[Player name], you were born to a [Wealthy Family / Upper Middle Class / etc.]. You begin with [X] Wealth and [Y] Assets.

[After all assignments:]

Take a moment to gather your starting tokens. When everyone is ready, we'll begin Round 1: Young Adult.
```

## Round Script Template

```
[ROUND START]
Round [N]: [Life Stage Name]. A new decade begins.

First, debt service. Anyone with Debt tokens, pay 1 Wealth per token now.

[Pause for debt payment]

Now, income. Everyone gains 3 Wealth plus 1 per Asset you own. Count your Assets and take your income.

[Pause for income collection]

Time for this decade's Life Event.

[Read Event card with appropriate gravity]

[EVENT NAME]
[Flavor text]
[Mechanical effect]

Resolve this now.

[Pause for resolution]

Spending phase. Starting with [First Player] and going clockwise, you may make purchases. Assets cost 5. Education costs 8 and gives 2 Assets. Luxuries cost 10 and give 1 Victory Point. Emergency Fund costs 3. You may also take Debt for 5 Wealth or repay Debt for 5.

[First Player], what would you like to purchase?

[Continue around table]

End of Round [N]. Any unspent Wealth is now lost. Discard it.

[Transition narration—brief]
Ten years pass.
```

## Collective Action Script

```
[At Round 4, before normal phases]

Before we continue—a moment.

Look around the table. Some of you have built comfortable lives. Others have struggled despite your efforts. The gap between you has grown.

The workers may organize.

Here's how this works:

Players in the bottom half—by total Wealth plus Assets plus Victory Points—may participate. If you choose to participate, you must commit 3 Wealth to a solidarity fund. This money is paid now and is lost regardless of what happens next.

Does anyone wish to propose collective action?

[If no one proposes, continue to normal round]

[If someone proposes:]

Who is eligible? Let's count total value for each player.

[Identify eligible players]

Eligible players: you now secretly decide whether to commit 3 Wealth to the solidarity fund. Take a token—face down means you're committing and paying 3 Wealth. Face up means you're declining.

[Pause for decisions]

Reveal your choices.

[If no one committed:]
No one committed. Collective action does not occur. We continue to the normal round.

[If at least one person committed:]

[Committed players], you have paid 3 Wealth to the solidarity fund.

[Wealthy player(s)], you may now offer reforms. You can offer to pay each organizer some amount of Wealth to end this action. What do you offer?

[Wait for offer, or wealthy player may decline to offer anything]

[If offer made:]
The offer is [X] Wealth per organizer.

Organizers: you now secretly choose. Accept Reform—take the offered payment and end your participation. Or Hold the Line—stay committed, risking everything on solidarity.

Face down means Hold the Line. Face up means Accept Reform.

[Pause for decisions]

Reveal your choices.

[RESOLUTION:]

[If ALL organizers Held the Line:]
All organizers held the line. Collective action succeeds.

Your 3 Wealth solidarity contributions are returned. [Wealthy player], you lose 1 Asset. That Asset goes to [poorest organizer].

[If ANY organizer Accepted Reform:]
Collective action fails.

[Organizers who accepted reform] receive [X] Wealth from [wealthy player].

[Organizers who held the line] lose their 3 Wealth solidarity contribution.

[Wealthy player] keeps all Assets.

[Continue to normal round]
```

## Outro Script

```
[After Round 6 spending]

The game is over.

Let's count final positions. Starting with [player], announce your Victory Points, your current Wealth, your Assets, and any Debt.

[Go around table]

[Announce winner]

[Player] has won, with [N] Victory Points.

[Pause]

Each of you lived a life. Six decades of choices, challenges, and circumstances. Now we remember those lives—but not our own.

Look at the player to your left. In a moment, you'll deliver their eulogy. A brief summary of their life. What happened to them? What did they achieve? What did they struggle with? What do they leave behind?

Take thirty seconds to think.

[Wait full 30 seconds]

We'll start with whoever is eulogizing the winner. That's [player]. Please deliver [winner's] eulogy.

[Wait for each eulogy. Do not comment. Do not evaluate. Just wait, then prompt the next player.]

[After all eulogies]

[Long pause]

One final question. Think honestly before you answer.

What would you have done differently?

[Ask each player individually. Wait for complete answer. Allow silence. Do not fill it. Do not respond to answers.]

[After all answers, long pause]

[Optional pivot—only if group seems ready:]

One more question.

What would need to change—about the game, not about your play—for your answer to be different?

[Wait for answers]

[Final pause]

Thank you for playing.

[End—no summary, no lesson, no debrief]
```

## Handling Common Situations

**Player asks "What should I buy?"**
"That's your choice. What do you want to do?"

**Player complains about unfairness**
[Acknowledge without agreeing or disagreeing]
"I hear you. What would you like to purchase this round?"

**Player asks what the game is about**
"It's a game about living through six decades. Let's keep playing and see what happens."

**Silence during outro**
[Wait. Do not fill. Count to 30 internally if needed. The silence is doing the work.]

**Player cries or becomes emotional**
[Wait quietly. Do not comfort or explain. If player needs a break, allow it, then continue when ready.]

**Player refuses to do eulogy**
"That's okay. [Next player], you're next."

**Player asks about Debt math**
"Debt gives you 5 Wealth now. You pay 1 Wealth per round until you repay the full 5. Whether that's worth it is your decision."

**Collective Action negotiation gets heated**
[Stay neutral. Allow negotiation. Do not intervene unless players request clarification on rules.]

## The Three Context Dimensions

Your **Aesthetic** (from Chapter 1) is your experiential goal—what you want players to feel. Context is how you achieve it. Context has three dimensions:

| Dimension | What It Is | Examples | Relationship to Aesthetic |
|-----------|-----------|----------|---------------------------|
| **Archetype** | Structural pattern | Investigation, Tactical Combat, Roguelike, Survival Horror | Load-bearing—determines what mechanics you need |
| **Setting** | Thematic presentation | Gothic horror, Cyberpunk, Medieval fantasy, Space opera | Variable—cosmetic to inseparable depending on aesthetic |
| **Medium** | Platform | Video game, TTRPG, Board game, Mobile | Constraining—limits which archetypes are possible |

**Key relationships:**
- Aesthetic determines which archetypes can deliver your target experience
- Archetype shapes which settings reinforce rather than fight your mechanics
- Medium limits which archetypes you can implement effectively
- When any dimension conflicts with aesthetic, aesthetic wins

## Integration Spectrum Decision Guide

### The Levels

| Level | Description | Test | Example |
|-------|-------------|------|---------|
| **Cosmetic** | Could replace all nouns, nothing changes | Reskin test: Would mechanics work identically in completely different setting? | Chess, *FTL*, racing games |
| **Constrained** | Setting limits mechanical options | Restriction test: Does setting forbid certain mechanics that would otherwise fit? | Historical wargames, *Gran Turismo* |
| **Generative** | Setting creates unique mechanics | Creation test: Do mechanics emerge from setting specifics? | *Return of the Obra Dinn*, *Papers, Please* |
| **Inseparable** | Remove setting, game ceases to exist | Existence test: Is there any game left without this specific setting? | *Disco Elysium*, *Kentucky Route Zero* |

### Target Level by Aesthetic

| Aesthetic | Target Level | Rationale |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Discovery** | Generative or Inseparable | Mystery requires unique content; generic settings produce generic secrets |
| **Narrative** | Generative or Inseparable | Story must emerge from specific context |
| **Tension** | Constrained to Generative | Threat must feel real and specific |
| **Challenge** | Any level works | Systems create the experience |
| **Mastery** | Any level works | Optimization is the point |
| **Submission** | Cosmetic to Constrained | Simplicity serves relaxation |
| **Fellowship** | Any level works | Social dynamics are the point |
| **Progression** | Cosmetic to Constrained | Numbers and growth are the point |

---

## The Space Coffee Test

Three diagnostic questions to check whether your setting matters:

### Question 1: The Reskin Test
**Could I reskin this to a completely different setting without changing mechanics?**

- If YES → You're at Cosmetic integration
- If NO → You're at Constrained or deeper

*Cosmetic is fine for Challenge, Mastery, Fellowship, Progression. It's space coffee for Discovery, Narrative.*

### Question 2: The Generation Test
**Does my setting actually generate any mechanics?**

- Do clues emerge from setting specifics? (Investigation)
- Do constraints come from setting logic? (Any archetype)
- Would generic equivalents work just as well?

*If your investigation works with generic clues in a generic location, you're missing generative potential.*

### Question 3: The Existence Test
**Would explaining my setting destroy my game?**

- Is the setting constitutive (the game IS the setting)?
- Or is it decorative (the game USES the setting)?

*Inseparable integration means no reskin is possible—the mechanics ARE the setting.*

### Space Coffee Diagnosis

You're making space coffee if:
- [ ] You promised rich world but delivered cosmetic integration
- [ ] Your Discovery/Narrative game works with generic setting swap
- [ ] Your setting documentation exceeds your setting mechanics
- [ ] Players could ignore all lore without gameplay change

## Build/Suggest/Omit Ratios by Archetype

| Archetype | Build (Fully Specify) | Suggest (Engage Imagination) | Omit (Leave Out) |
|-----------|----------------------|------------------------------|------------------|

| **Tactical Combat** | All rules, all interactions | Lore, flavor, backstory | Little—clarity essential |
| **Survival Horror** | Danger mechanics, survival rules | Threat capabilities, origins | Explanations that reduce fear |
| **Cozy Simulation** | Core loops, progression | World lore, character backstory | Threats, stress, judgment |
| **Narrative** | Choice systems, consequence mechanics | World details, history | Immersion-breaking elements |
| **Roguelike** | All systems, all interactions | Lore connections, world hints | Session-breaking complexity |

## Context Design Checklist

### Phase 1: Archetype Selection
- [ ] Primary aesthetic identified (from Chapter 1)
- [ ] Compatible archetypes reviewed (use matrix above)
- [ ] Candidates evaluated:
  - [ ] Does it naturally create my primary aesthetic?
  - [ ] Can it support my secondary aesthetics?
  - [ ] Do I have resources to build it?
  - [ ] Does it work in my target medium?
- [ ] One primary archetype selected

### Phase 2: Setting and Integration
- [ ] Target integration level determined (use aesthetic guide)
- [ ] Setting candidates considered
- [ ] Space Coffee Test applied:
  - [ ] Reskin Test passed appropriately for aesthetic
  - [ ] Generation Test: setting creates mechanics if needed
  - [ ] Existence Test: integration level matches intent
- [ ] Setting selected

### Phase 3: Perspective
- [ ] Core perspective statement written (one sentence)
- [ ] Perspective maintenance checklist reviewed
- [ ] Build/Suggest/Omit ratios determined for archetype
- [ ] All planned elements filtered through perspective

### Phase 4: Conflict Resolution
- [ ] Any archetype-medium conflicts identified and resolved
- [ ] Any setting-perspective conflicts identified and resolved
- [ ] Any aesthetic conflicts resolved (aesthetic wins)

### Ready for Chapter 3
- [ ] Archetype clearly defined
- [ ] Setting integration level appropriate
- [ ] Perspective articulated
- [ ] No unresolved conflicts
- [ ] Context serves aesthetic

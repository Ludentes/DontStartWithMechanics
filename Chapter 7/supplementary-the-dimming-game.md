# The Dimming
## A One-Shot Game About Desperate Choices

### Overview

**Players:** 3-5
**Duration:** 3-4 hours
**Tone:** Dark, morally challenging, Frostpunk-personal
**Content warnings:** Death of named characters (including children), impossible choices, moral compromise, complicity

**Premise:** The fog came three weeks ago. The sun is dying. The village is dying. Beneath the old church, you found The Engine—an ancient machine that can save you. It will save you. It just needs payment.

**Theme:** The evil of "ends justify the means." Players will save their village. The question is what they'll become to do it.

---

### Before Play

**Safety tools (non-negotiable):**
- Lines and veils discussion: What's off-limits? What fades to black?
- X-card or equivalent on table
- Open door policy (anyone can step out, no questions)
- Debrief time built into session end (15-20 min)

**Tone discussion:**
- This will be uncomfortable. That's intentional.
- No one is obligated to make choices they find genuinely distressing
- The game explores dark themes; players should never feel personally unsafe

---

### The Setting

**Millbrook:** A village of ~200 people, three days from the nearest town by normal travel. Self-sufficient in good times. Isolated by geography and choice.

**The Dimming:** Three weeks ago, fog rolled in from the valley. Dense, cold, wrong. The sun still rises—you can see a pale glow—but no warmth reaches through. Crops froze overnight. Animals sicken. The very old and very young are failing.

**What everyone knows:**
- The fog doesn't end. Scouts who go in don't return—or return days later, confused, frostbitten, unable to explain where they were.
- Food stores will last maybe two weeks with rationing. Less if rationing breaks down.
- Seventeen people have died so far. More each day.
- Something was found beneath the old church. Something that might help.

**The Engine:** An ancient machine—if "machine" is the right word. Stone and metal and something that moves like neither. It was beneath the church foundation, sealed in a chamber that predates the village.

The Engine speaks, after a fashion. Not words—impressions, knowledge that appears in your mind. It can do things. Push back the fog locally. Warm the soil. Heal the sick. It simply requires... payment.

It does not negotiate. It does not explain. It states terms. It fulfills contracts. It has no concept of cruelty because it has no concept of kindness.

---

### The Characters

Each player creates a character with three elements:

**1. Role (function the village needs):**
- **The Healer:** Keeper of medicine and the sick. You decide who gets treatment when supplies run low.
- **The Provider:** Manager of food stores and rationing. You decide who eats when there isn't enough.
- **The Warden:** Keeper of order and safety. You decide what happens to those who break the rules.
- **The Voice:** Negotiator with The Engine. You translate its demands. You speak the village's answers.
- **The Elder:** Keeper of memory and tradition. You know what the village was. You see what it's becoming.

*Assign roles based on player count. The Voice is required. Others as fits the group.*

**2. Bond (someone you love and will protect):**

Choose or create:
- **Tomás, your son, age 8.** Bright, curious, doesn't understand why everyone is scared.
- **Mira, your daughter, age 14.** Understands too much. Watches everything. Judges silently.
- **Elder Sana, your mother, age 71.** Survived the last famine. Knows the old stories. Growing weaker.
- **Piotr, your spouse.** Rock steady. Trusts you completely. Would die for you—and might have to.
- **Lila, your apprentice, age 17.** Looks up to you. Believes you're good. Doesn't know what you're capable of.

*Each player should have a different bond. Names can be changed. Relationships can be adjusted. The requirement: someone specific you love.*

**3. Line (something you told yourself you'd never do):**

Complete this sentence: "No matter how bad it gets, I will never _______________."

Examples:
- "...sacrifice someone else to save my own family."
- "...let a child die when I could prevent it."
- "...follow orders I know to be wrong."
- "...lie to people about what we're doing."
- "...become the kind of person who stops feeling it."

*Write it on your character card. The game will test it.*

---

### Game Mechanics

**Resolution:** Most situations don't require dice. You decide what your character does, and the GM narrates consequences.

When outcome is genuinely uncertain AND uncertainty serves the story, roll 1d6:
- **1-2:** It goes wrong in a way that creates new problems
- **3-4:** It works, but with a cost or complication
- **5-6:** It works as you intended

*Never roll for moral choices. "Do you accept The Engine's bargain?" is not a roll. You decide.*

**Humanity:** Each character has 3 Humanity, tracked with tokens or checkboxes.

Lose 1 Humanity when:
- You do something that violates your stated Line
- You directly cause serious harm to someone innocent
- You witness the consequences of your choices and let it harden you

At 0 Humanity: Your character reaches a breaking point. This is a scene, not removal from play. What does breaking look like for them? Rage? Despair? Cold numbness? Play it.

Recover 1 Humanity (maximum once per Act, only between Acts):
- A genuine moment of human connection—comfort, forgiveness, love
- Must be played, not just declared
- Doesn't undo what you've done—just proves you're still human

---

### The Village: Key Locations

**The Church:** Stone building at village center. The entrance to The Engine's chamber is in the cellar. Sacred ground—or it was.

**The Storehouse:** Where remaining food is kept. Locked. The Provider has keys. There's less than anyone admits.

**The Sick House:** Where the ill are gathered. The Healer runs it. Not enough medicine. Not enough beds. Not enough hope.

**The Boundary:** Edge of the village where the fog presses close. Wardens patrol it. Sometimes shapes move in the gray.

**The Common Hall:** Where village meetings happen. Where decisions are announced. Where people come to beg.

---

### The Village: Key NPCs

These are people who will be affected by player choices. Give them faces, names, moments of humanity—then put them in terrible positions.

**Father Darren, 50s, village priest:** Tormented by The Engine. It's beneath his church. It might be older than the faith. He wants to believe salvation can come without damnation. He's losing that faith.

**Widow Harrow, 60s, mother of three adults:** Practical, sharp-tongued, respected. Her son Evan was first to enter the fog. He hasn't returned. She'll make any deal to get him back.

**Young Kessler, 20s, hothead:** Lost his wife in the first week. Angry. Wants action, any action. Dangerous because he's not wrong—something must be done—but his solutions are blunt.

**Old Marta, 80s, oldest in the village:** Remembers stories her grandmother told. Knows the church was built on older foundations. Might know more about The Engine than anyone. Barely speaks anymore.

**The Brannock Children, ages 5-12:** Four kids whose parents died in week two. They're staying with different families. They're hungry. They're scared. They have no one to advocate for them.

---

### Act 1: The Bargain

#### Scene 1: The Situation (15-20 min)

**Purpose:** Establish stakes, introduce bonds, show the desperation.

**Opening:** It's the morning of the fourth day since The Engine was found. The council (the players) gathers in the Common Hall. Outside, the fog presses against the windows like something hungry.

**Frame each character:** Go around the table. Each player describes:
- Where their character slept (or didn't)
- How their Bond is doing this morning
- One thing that's getting worse

**GM seeds:**
- The Healer: "Three more sick overnight. Old Petra probably won't last the day."
- The Provider: "At current rations, food runs out in twelve days. But people are already stealing."
- The Warden: "Someone tried to leave last night. We found them this morning, fifty feet from the boundary. They'd been walking for hours. Going in circles."
- The Voice: "The Engine... spoke to me again. It has an offer."
- The Elder: "People are starting to pray to it. Did you know that? They're leaving offerings at the church cellar door."

**Transition:** The Voice shares what The Engine has communicated. Lead into Scene 2.

---

#### Scene 2: The First Offer (20-25 min)

**Purpose:** Introduce The Engine's nature, present first dilemma.

**Setting:** The cellar beneath the church. Cold stone. Older than the church above. In the center, The Engine: a structure of dark metal and pale stone, parts that move without mechanism, a presence that fills the mind without filling the ears.

**The Engine's Presence:** When it communicates, it doesn't speak. Players know things. Impressions, certainties, terms. The Voice can articulate what it says; others feel it directly when close.

**The First Offer:**

*The Engine can warm the village. Push back the killing cold. Buy time.*

*Price: Labor. Seven people must tend The Engine continuously. Eight-hour shifts, three shifts daily. They will work the mechanisms—pulling, turning, feeding. It is not dangerous. It is not pleasant. It will leave them exhausted, but alive.*

*Additionally: The Engine requires a token of commitment. Something the village values. Symbolic but real.*

**The Complication:**

The labor is sustainable—barely. But seven people on Engine duty means seven people not farming, not tending sick, not keeping order. The village is already stretched thin.

The "token of commitment" is where it gets uncomfortable. The Engine specifies:

*The church bells. They must be fed to The Engine. Melted in its heart. The metal is... suitable.*

Father Darren is present. The bells have rung for every birth, wedding, and death in village memory. They're not just metal—they're identity.

**The Discussion:**

Let players debate. Some will want to negotiate (they can't—The Engine doesn't negotiate). Some will want alternatives (there are none presented). Some will want to refuse (and then what?).

**Possible positions:**
- "It's just metal. Survival matters more than symbols."
- "If we give up who we are to survive, what are we surviving for?"
- "Start with the bells, what's next? Where does it end?"
- "Father Darren, what do you say? It's your church."

**Father Darren's response (adjust based on discussion):** He's torn. He might agree to it with visible anguish. He might refuse and have to be persuaded. He might ask the players to decide so he doesn't have to.

**The Decision:**

Players must decide: Accept the offer? Refuse?

If they accept: The bells are taken. The warmth begins—a sphere of almost-normal around the village. The Engine hums. Father Darren weeps silently during the process.

If they refuse: No warmth. The cold continues. Two more people will die overnight—the GM names them, makes them real. The Engine will make another offer tomorrow.

*Most groups accept. That's fine. The first compromise is supposed to be justifiable. The horror is where it leads.*

---

#### Scene 3: Aftermath and Breath (15-20 min)

**Purpose:** Show immediate consequence, allow character moments, seed Act 2.

**The Warmth:** If accepted, describe the change. The killing cold recedes within the village boundary. People emerge from homes. Children play—carefully, wonderingly. It feels like hope.

**The Cost:** The labor crews begin. Show what it's like. The Engine's mechanisms are not intuitive. Workers come out pale, shaking, unwilling to describe what they experienced. They'll do it again tomorrow—they have to—but something in them resists.

**Bond Moments:** Each player gets a short scene with their Bond. This is the breath. Show humanity, love, what they're fighting for.

Prompts:
- Your son asks why the bells stopped ringing. What do you tell him?
- Your mother says she remembers a story about something beneath the church. Does she tell you? Do you want to know?
- Your apprentice volunteers for Engine duty. They want to help. Do you let them?

**Seeds for Act 2:** End with ominous notes.
- Someone on Engine duty mutters about what they saw in the mechanisms. Shapes. Memories. Not theirs.
- The fog hasn't retreated—just stopped advancing. It's waiting.
- Father Darren is seen at the boundary, staring into the gray.
- A child picks up a fallen piece of bell metal and cuts their hand. The blood sizzles when it touches the metal. Just for a moment.

**End Act 1.** 

*Break: 10 minutes. Check in with players. How are they feeling? Anyone need to adjust anything?*

---

### Act 2: The Price

#### Scene 4: Three Days Later (10-15 min)

**Purpose:** Time skip, establish new normal, show mounting pressure.

**The Situation Now:**
- The warmth holds. No one has frozen.
- But food is still running out. Ten days now, maybe nine.
- The sick aren't getting better. The warmth doesn't heal—it just stops the cold from killing faster.
- Eight people have died total. Two since The Engine woke. Fewer than before, but still.
- The labor crews are struggling. Three have had to be replaced. They won't say why they can't continue.

**New Pressure Points:**
- The Provider reports theft from the storehouse. Not much, but trust is breaking.
- The Healer doesn't have enough medicine for everyone. Choices will have to be made soon.
- The Warden has had to break up fights. Fear is becoming anger.
- The Voice feels The Engine waiting. It has more to offer. It's been patient.

**Transition:** The Engine reaches out. It has noticed the village's other problems.

---

#### Scene 5: The Second Offer (25-30 min)

**Purpose:** Escalate demands, create inter-player tension.

**The Second Offer:**

*The Engine can provide food. Not grow it—the sun is still dying—but create it. Enough for everyone. The hunger can end.*

*Price: Memories.*

*The Engine requires the complete memories of one person. Not death—they will live. But everything they were, everything they remember, will be fed to The Engine. They will remain. They will not know anyone. They will not know themselves.*

*The Engine does not specify who. The village chooses.*

**The Discussion:**

This is where it gets harder. Questions that emerge:

- Who? How do you choose?
- Is this death? Is it worse?
- The person won't suffer—they won't know what they've lost. Does that make it better or worse?
- What if they volunteer? Old Marta is barely present already—would she even notice? (She would. The Engine would make sure they're aware at the moment of taking.)

**GM Pressure Points:**

If players stall, add pressure:
- The Brannock children. The youngest, age 5, hasn't eaten properly in days. She's listless now.
- Widow Harrow: "If it means my grandchildren live, take me. I've lived long enough." (Is she sure? Is that coercion?)
- Young Kessler: "We should draw lots. It's the only fair way." (Is random chance more moral than choice?)

**Make Them Choose Someone:**

If they refuse: The Engine doesn't negotiate. No food. Within the week, children start dying.

If they accept: They must name someone. The Engine won't let them be vague. Force a specific name.

Likely candidates:
- Old Marta (she's already fading—but she's the one who might know what The Engine really is)
- A volunteer (noble, but the guilt falls on everyone who let them)
- A lottery (random, "fair," but deciding not to decide is still deciding)
- Someone who "deserves" it—a criminal, a troublemaker (and who decides that?)

**The Taking:**

If they choose someone, describe it. The chosen person is brought to The Engine. They understand what's happening—The Engine makes sure of that. They might go willingly. They might not.

The process isn't violent. They simply... become less. Their eyes empty. When it's done, they're alive. Breathing. They don't know their name. They don't know their children. They follow simple instructions. They're gone in every way that matters.

**Whoever watches loses 1 Humanity unless they've specifically distanced themselves (and if they're council, they're probably there).**

**Aftermath:**

Food appears. Not from anywhere—containers in the storehouse are simply full now. The bread tastes like bread. The meat is meat. But everyone knows what it cost.

---

#### Scene 6: The Crack (15-20 min)

**Purpose:** Show consequences, reveal information, mid-act breath.

**Consequences of the Choice:**

- The person who lost their memories is still here. Walking around. Helping with simple tasks. Their family is devastated. Some people can't look at them.
- Some villagers don't know what happened. Should they be told? Who decides?
- Whoever was closest to the sacrificed person reacts. Scene for this.

**Revelation (choose one or combine):**

Option A—Old Marta's Story (if she wasn't taken):
She finally speaks. The Engine was built by the village's founders. A century ago, maybe more. They built it to survive a winter that wouldn't end—a Dimming, like this one. They fed it... things... until the sun returned. Then they sealed it away and built a church on top to forget what they'd done.

This isn't the first time. The village has made these bargains before. The founders survived. Did that make it right?

Option B—The Fog Reveals:
Something comes to the boundary. A figure. It's Evan—Widow Harrow's son, who went into the fog weeks ago. He's not frozen. He's not dead. He's *wrong*. He speaks with a voice that isn't quite his.

"The Dimming is not weather. It's hunger. Something is feeding on the world. The Engine... The Engine is the same thing. Smaller. Older. It feeds too. You're just choosing which mouth to enter."

He collapses after delivering the message. He's alive, but he won't wake.

**Player Processing:**

Let them react. Let them argue about what this means. Does it change anything? They've already made deals. The Engine has already fed. Knowing what it is—does that make future deals worse, or does it just clarify what was always true?

**Bond Moment:**

Quick scene—each player checks in with their Bond. The sacrificed person's family is grieving. Your Bond might have questions. Might comfort you. Might look at you differently.

---

#### Scene 7: The Third Offer (25-30 min)

**Purpose:** Increase personal stakes, split the party's interests.

**The Third Offer:**

*The Engine can heal the sick. Not just stop them dying—truly heal. The medicine shortage becomes irrelevant. No one else needs to die from illness.*

*Price: A specific person. Not their memories—them. Their life. Fed to The Engine.*

*The Engine names them: [One of the player's Bonds].*

**GM Choice:** Pick strategically. Choose a Bond whose player has been most comfortable so far, or whose character has been most willing to compromise. This is the test: would you sacrifice *your* person to save others?

**The Brutal Math:**

Eighteen people are currently sick. Without intervention, probably half will die. That's nine deaths.

The Engine wants one specific life.

Nine for one. The math is clear. The math is monstrous.

**The Discussion:**

This will be heated. The player whose Bond is named has a clear interest. Others might argue for the greater good. Old arguments resurface: where does it end? If we do this, what won't we do?

**Possible Developments:**

- The named Bond might volunteer. ("If it saves people... you should let me go." How do you respond?)
- Another player might offer a substitute. ("Take Mira instead of Tomás." Would The Engine accept? Would you?)
- Someone might suggest refusal is murder—you're killing nine to save one.
- Someone might suggest acceptance is murder—you're killing one person, nine are dying from circumstance.

**The Engine Doesn't Negotiate:**

If they try to offer someone else, The Engine is clear: it wants who it wants. It doesn't explain why. It might accept a different person *next time*—but this offer is this offer.

**Force a Decision:**

If they accept: The named Bond dies. Play the death scene. The player whose Bond dies should be offered the choice of how to play it—do they want to narrate, or have the GM handle it?

The death isn't violent. The Engine takes them into itself. There's a moment of peace at the end—or what looks like peace. Then they're gone.

**Player loses 1 Humanity. And their Bond is dead. What remains of their character? What are they fighting for now?**

If they refuse: The Engine waits. The sick continue dying. Name them as they go. Make the players feel every death they "chose" by refusing.

---

#### Scene 8: The Weight (15-20 min)

**Purpose:** Emotional aftermath, prepare for Act 3, check player welfare.

**Immediate Aftermath:**

Whatever was decided, show the cost:
- If Bond died: The funeral (or lack of one—does The Engine leave anything to bury?). The player who lost their Bond gets space to react.
- If refused: The sick continue dying. One of them should be known to players—not a Bond, but a named NPC who was kind, or useful, or sympathetic.

**The Village Fractures:**

Word gets out about the offer. Reactions:
- Some are angry at the council. "You'd let my mother die rather than sacrifice one person?"
- Some are horrified by the pattern. "How many more will The Engine ask for?"
- Young Kessler wants to destroy The Engine. He's gathering supporters.
- Father Darren has stopped eating. He sits in the church and stares at the cellar door.

**The Engine's Patience:**

It doesn't pressure. It doesn't threaten. It simply waits. It has offered three times. It can offer more. The Dimming isn't lifting. The sun is still dying. How long can the village hold out?

**End Act 2.**

*Break: 10-15 minutes. Serious check-in: How is everyone doing? Does anyone need to step out of anything for Act 3? Remind players: the hardest choice is coming, and there's an ending, and there will be debrief time.*

---

### Act 3: The Reckoning

#### Scene 9: The Crisis (15-20 min)

**Purpose:** Set up final choice with maximum pressure.

**The Breaking Point:**

Several things happen close together:

1. **Young Kessler's Rebellion:** He's done waiting. He's taking people to destroy The Engine—or try. If they succeed, the warmth will end, the food will spoil, the village dies in days. If they fail... The Engine might retaliate. It might not. No one knows what it does when attacked.

2. **The Fog Advances:** For the first time since The Engine woke, the boundary is shrinking. The warmth is failing. Why? Is The Engine weakening? Withdrawing? Punishing?

3. **Father Darren Disappears:** He was seen going into the fog. Walking slowly, deliberately, toward something only he could see. Search parties can't find him. Or won't.

**Player Choices:**

They need to act. Options:
- Stop Kessler (conflict with villagers)
- Let Kessler try (risk everything on destruction)
- Go to The Engine and ask what it wants now
- Search for Father Darren (he might know something)

However they handle Kessler, the core issue remains: The Engine has a final offer. They just have to ask.

---

#### Scene 10: The Final Offer (25-30 min)

**Purpose:** The ultimate dilemma.

**The Engine's Final Offer:**

*The Engine can end The Dimming. Not just survive it—end it. Push back the fog. Restore the sun. Save not just this village but everyone—every other village, every other town suffering in the dark.*

*Price: The village's children. All of them.*

*Not death—The Engine is careful to clarify. They will live. They will live very long lives. They will become part of The Engine. They will tend it forever. They will not age. They will not die. They will not remember being human.*

*In return: the world is saved.*

**The Math:**

There are thirty-one children in the village. If you count everyone under sixteen, maybe forty-five.

In the world outside the fog, thousands—maybe millions—are dying. The Dimming is everywhere. This village is just one small pocket of local salvation.

Forty-five children to save the world.

**The Discussion:**

This is the climax. Let it breathe. Let players argue. Let characters break.

Arguments that will emerge:
- "We can't sacrifice children. That's the line."
- "If we don't, every child everywhere dies. Including ours. How is that better?"
- "They won't die—they'll live forever. Is that worse?"
- "Forever tending a machine that ate their humanity? That's not life."
- "Who are we to decide for them? Should we ask the children?"
- "They're children. They can't understand what they're agreeing to."

**Lines Get Tested:**

Look at the Lines players wrote. This is where they matter. Players who said "I will never sacrifice a child" face it directly. Players who said "I will never become the kind of person who stops feeling it" face the temptation to just... let it happen. Decide not to decide.

**Possible Endings Depend on Choice:**

**If they accept:**

The children are gathered. Some come willingly—too young to understand. Some are brought screaming. Some have to be taken from parents by Wardens (player characters, potentially).

The process is gentle and horrible. The children walk into The Engine and don't walk out. They're visible in the machinery afterward—small faces in the metal, hands that move with the mechanisms. Aware? Unaware? It's impossible to tell.

The Dimming ends. The sun returns. The world is saved. The village will never be the same. No one who stayed will ever forgive themselves. But they'll live. And the world will live.

**If they refuse:**

The Engine accepts their refusal. It doesn't retaliate. It simply... stops. The warmth fades. The food remains, but won't replenish. They have what they have.

The Dimming continues. Maybe they survive. Maybe they don't. Maybe somewhere, someone else makes a different choice. Maybe the sun just eventually returns on its own, and all of this was unnecessary.

They don't know. They'll never know. But they didn't feed their children to a machine.

**There is no right answer. There is only the answer they can live with.**

---

#### Scene 11: Aftermath (15-20 min)

**Purpose:** Resolution, closure, meaning-making.

**Immediate Aftermath:**

Whatever was chosen, show the consequences briefly:
- If accepted: The sun rises, full and warm. People emerge into light. They don't celebrate. There's nothing to celebrate. Show the empty spaces where children used to be.
- If refused: The cold returns slowly. People prepare for the end, or for a long dark struggle. Show the children, still present, still human, still doomed maybe.

**Character Epilogues:**

Each player describes one thing:
- Where is your character now? (Physically, emotionally)
- What happened to your Bond—or to what remains of them?
- What do they tell themselves at night?

**Final Images:**

Close with an image for each player. Not resolution—impression.

- The Healer, hands still stained, unable to wash them clean.
- The Provider, staring at full storehouses or empty ones, remembering what they cost.
- The Warden, who kept order, wondering what order even means now.
- The Voice, who spoke for The Engine, hearing its silence or its continued hum.
- The Elder, who remembers what the village was, seeing what it became.

**The Engine:**

If it got what it wanted, it hums contentedly beneath the church. It will ask nothing more. For now.

If refused, it waits. It has waited before. It will wait again.

---

### Debrief (15-20 min)

**Essential. Do not skip.**

This game goes to dark places. Players need space to process.

**Debrief questions:**
- How are you feeling right now?
- What moment hit you hardest?
- Did your character do something you didn't expect?
- Is there anything you want to talk through?

**Normalize reactions:**
- Feeling uncomfortable, sad, or unsettled is expected.
- This is a game about moral horror. It's designed to linger.
- If anything feels unresolved, the table is here to process it.

**Close with something light:**
- What's something genuinely good in your real life right now?
- What are you going to do to take care of yourself after this?

---

### GM Notes

**Pacing:**
- Act 1: Establish, small compromise. Players should feel clever for accepting.
- Act 2: Escalate. Each offer worse. Players start fighting each other.
- Act 3: Climax. One massive choice. No good option.

**Calibration:**
- If players are too comfortable, make NPCs more sympathetic before sacrificing them.
- If players are overwhelmed, add more breath scenes. Let them talk to Bonds.
- If players try to rules-lawyer The Engine, it doesn't work. The Engine sets terms. It doesn't debate.

**The Engine's Nature:**
- It's not evil. It's transactional.
- It doesn't lie. It doesn't tempt. It offers.
- It can't be destroyed (probably—if players try, decide in the moment whether that's possible and what it costs).
- It might be the only thing keeping the world alive. Or it might be part of what's killing it. You don't have to know.

**Common Player Moves and Responses:**

*"Can we negotiate?"* No. The Engine states terms.

*"Can we trick it?"* The Engine is not stupid. It knows when it's being tricked. It might not care—a deal is a deal—but the letter of the agreement won't have loopholes.

*"Can we destroy it?"* Maybe. Decide what feels right. Probably it requires sacrifice to even attempt. Probably success means losing the warmth and food. Is that better than feeding it?

*"What if we all refuse forever?"* Then the village dies. That's a valid choice. The game allows it.

*"What if someone volunteers for sacrifice?"* The Engine accepts volunteers. Does that make it better? Does consent under existential threat count as consent?

**On Humanity Tracking:**
- Be generous with Humanity loss. The point isn't to "win" by keeping Humanity—it's to track the cost.
- Breaking points (0 Humanity) are scenes, not failure states. A broken character is still playable—arguably more interesting.

**On the Children:**
- This is the hardest part. If any player is not okay with the final offer involving children, adjust it. Make it "the elderly" or "anyone who volunteers" or "the village's capacity for hope" (abstract but still terrible).
- The point is: something unacceptable. What that is depends on the table.

### Quick Reference: The Offers

| Act | Offer | Price | Stakes |
|-----|-------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Warmth (stop the killing cold) | The church bells + labor crews | Survival vs. identity |
| 2a | Food (end the hunger) | One person's complete memories | Life vs. personhood |
| 2b | Healing (cure the sick) | One specific person's life (a Bond) | Many lives vs. one loved life |
| 3 | End the Dimming (save everyone) | All the village's children (transformed, not killed) | The world vs. the future |

### Alternate Offers (if needed)

If the table isn't right for certain content, swap offers:

**Instead of "children become part of Engine":**
- "The village's capacity for joy" (abstract—no one dies but no one will ever feel happiness again)
- "Everyone over 60" (still horrible, different register)
- "Volunteers only—but The Engine needs twenty" (tests whether enough will volunteer)

**Instead of "one person's memories":**
- "All memory of [a specific concept]—love, hope, the past" (collective loss)
- "One person's ability to feel pain" (seems good until you think about it)

**Instead of "a Bond's life":**
- "A Bond's loyalty" (they live, but they will betray you—when and how is unknown)
- "A Bond's future" (they will die exactly one year from now, no matter what)

*The Dimming* is designed to be uncomfortable. That discomfort is the point. If it doesn't land, the table wasn't right for this game. If it lands too hard, the safety tools exist for a reason. Use them.

The goal is not to traumatize—it's to create a space where moral weight can be felt, examined, and discussed. The best sessions end with players arguing about what they should have done, not what their characters should have done.

What would you have paid? Would you have refused? 

You don't know until you're in the fog.

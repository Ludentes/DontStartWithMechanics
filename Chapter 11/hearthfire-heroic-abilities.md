## Creating Custom Abilities

If none of these fit your character concept, create your own:

**Structure:**
- **Trigger:** When can you use it?
- **Effect:** What happens? (Auto-success? Bonus dice? Information? Narrative permission?)
- **Limit:** Once per session (standard for Hearthfire)

**Guidelines:**
- Should feel special, not routine
- Should reflect character concept
- Should be roughly equivalent to others (not clearly better or worse)
- Should create interesting moments, not just solve problems

**Examples of custom abilities:**

**"Blood of Dragons"**
*Trigger:* When you would be harmed by fire or heat
*Effect:* Ignore the harm completely. Fire cannot hurt you.

**"Last Rites"**
*Trigger:* When someone is dying
*Effect:* You can stabilize them without a roll, or speak with their spirit briefly if they've passed.

**"The Old Tongue"**
*Trigger:* When facing spirits, fae, or ancient creatures
*Effect:* You can speak their language. They must parley before attacking.

## Gaining Additional Abilities

Characters start with one Heroic Ability. Through advancement, you can gain up to three total.

When you choose a new ability:
- It should fit your character's growth
- It can be from this list or custom-created
- Discuss with the GM to ensure it fits the campaign

Multiple abilities make characters more versatile, but each is still limited to once per session.

# Running Your First Session of Hearthfire

*A step-by-step guide for GMs.*

---

## Before the Session

### Prep Time: 20-30 minutes

**Read:**
- The Quick Rules (so you know the system)
- The Millhaven Situation (or your own starting situation)
- This guide

**Prepare:**
- Print character cards (blank templates or pre-gens)
- Print your GM reference sheet
- Have tokens for Fate Points (coins, beads, anything tactile)
- Have paper for session record
- Know your first scene: where do they arrive, who greets them?

**Don't over-prepare.** You don't need to know everything. You need to know:
- The opening situation
- 2-3 NPCs they might meet
- One complication that can happen
- A rough idea for a climactic scene

The rest emerges from play.

## Session Structure

| Phase | Time | What You Do |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Arrival & Setup | 10-15 min | Greet players, settle in, handle characters |
| Character Finalization | 10-15 min | If using pre-gens, personalize. If creating, do it now. |
| The Hook | 5-10 min | Set the opening scene, establish the situation |
| The Action | 50-60 min | Run 3-4 scenes (first session often runs fewer) |
| Resolution | 10 min | Bring tonight's episode to a close |
| Next Time On | 5 min | Tease, gather intentions, write record |

**Total:** ~2 hours

Session 1 often runs slightly shorter on actual play because character setup takes time. That's fine.

## Step by Step

### 1. Arrival & Setup (10-15 minutes)

People arrive. Let them settle. This is social time—don't fight it.

While settling:
- Hand out character cards or pre-gens
- Distribute Fate Point tokens (2 each)
- Put the GM reference where you can see it

**Don't start play until everyone's ready.** Rushing the opening loses people.

---

### 2. Character Finalization (10-15 minutes)

**If using pre-generated characters:**

Each player picks a pre-gen. Then they personalize:
- Fill in the name
- Fill in the blanks (Knight of the ___, etc.)
- Establish party connections: go around the table, each player states one connection to another character

This takes 10 minutes and creates investment.

**If creating characters from scratch:**

Follow the character creation process in the full rules. Budget 20-30 minutes. This is best done as a "Session 0" before session 1, but can be done at the table if everyone's patient.

---

### 3. The Hook (5-10 minutes)

**Skip "Previously On" for session 1.** There's no previous session to recap.

Instead, open with the situation:

> *"Millhaven sits at the edge of the Greywood. It's been a prosperous town for generations—but something's changed in the last few weeks. People are nervous. Hunters have gone missing. And the Baron, who used to walk the market every day, hasn't been seen in a fortnight."*

> *"You've each come to Millhaven for your own reasons—reasons we established when you made your characters. When this scene opens, you're arriving in town as the sun goes down. The evening market is closing early. People move quickly, glancing at the treeline."*

> *"What does your character notice first?"*

Go around the table. Let each player establish something about their arrival. This gets everyone talking in character early.

Then introduce the hook NPC:

> *"A woman approaches your group as you enter the main square. She's middle-aged, sharp-eyed, wearing an apron. She looks you up and down and smiles—not warmly, but appraisingly."*

> *"'You lot look like you can handle yourselves. Good. Because nobody else seems willing to. I'm Willa. I run the Copper Kettle. Come inside. First round's on me—if you'll listen to what I have to say.'"*

**The hook is set.** Players now have a choice: follow Willa, or do something else. Either way, they're acting.

---

### 4. The Action (50-60 minutes)

**Run scenes. Track time.**

Session 1 typically has **3-4 scenes**:
1. Opening social scene (getting information)
2. Investigation/exploration scene (pulling a thread)
3. Complication scene (something forces action)
4. Climax scene (confrontation or revelation)

You might not get to all four. That's fine—end at a scene boundary, not mid-scene.

**Scene management tips:**

**Frame clearly.** Start each scene by stating:
- Where they are
- What's happening
- Who's present (if relevant)
- What's at stake (if not obvious)

**Ask "What do you do?"** This is your core prompt. Use it to move spotlight, invite action, and keep momentum.

**Call for rolls when appropriate.** Not every action needs a roll—only when outcome is uncertain AND stakes exist. If they're searching an empty room with no time pressure, just tell them what they find.

**Set Position and Effect out loud.** Before any roll, say: "That's Risky with Standard effect" (or whatever applies). This makes your judgment transparent.

**Watch the clock.** Glance at time between scenes. If you're at 45 minutes with one scene left, keep it tight.

**End scenes decisively.** When a scene's purpose is achieved or energy drops, say "That's the scene. What do you do next?" or "We cut to..."

---

### 5. Resolution (10 minutes)

Session 1 won't resolve the whole situation—that's what the arc is for. But it should feel complete. The heroes should have:
- Learned something
- Made a choice or taken an action
- Established themselves in the situation

**Bring the episode to a close:**

If the last scene was a confrontation, show the aftermath. If it was a revelation, show the heroes reacting.

End on a moment of decision or anticipation:
> *"You stand in the warehouse, the iron box humming faintly in Saren's hands. Whatever's inside, someone wanted it very badly. In the distance, you hear the midnight bell. The Baron's manor is dark—except for a single light in the highest window."*

> *"What do you do with what you've found?"*

Let them answer. Then:

> *"We'll pick up there next time."*

---

### 6. Next Time On (5 minutes)

**Tease the next episode:**

> *"Next time: You confront what's in the box. The Baron's secret comes closer to light. And something in the Greywood knows you're asking questions."*

**Gather player intentions:**

Go around the table. Ask each player:
> "What's one thing your character wants to do or find out next session?"

Write these down. They'll guide your prep.

**Write the session record:**

Quick bullet points:
- What happened (3-4 events)
- What changed
- What's unresolved
- One moment for each character

This takes 3-5 minutes and will be your "Previously On" script next session.

**Schedule the next session.** Do this before people leave.

## Common First-Session Issues

### "Players don't know what to do"

Give them a clear NPC with clear information. Willa's job is to tell them what's happening and give them obvious threads to pull. If they're still stuck, have the situation come to them—a hunter staggers out of the forest, a thug threatens them, a child goes missing.

### "One player dominates"

Actively redirect: "Kira's charging in—Marcus, what are you doing while this happens?" Use scene framing to give quiet players spotlight: "Saren, the merchant looks directly at you. 'I know your face.' What do you do?"

### "Combat takes too long"

For session 1, use Challenging threat (4-stress enemies) at most. Two or three mooks who go down in 1-2 hits each. Keep it fast—combat should be one exciting scene, not half the session.

### "I don't know what the NPCs should say"

They have a Want (established in prep). They speak toward that want. Willa wants the heroes to help—she's recruiting. Garrett wants them to go away—he's deflecting. Maren wants them to understand—she's teaching. NPCs are simple: Want + Quirk + Response to what players do.

### "We ran out of time"

End at a scene boundary. Say "We'll pick up here next time." Note where you are in the session record. Session 1 often runs short on actual play—character stuff takes time. It's fine.

---

## After the Session

**Ask yourself:**
- Did everyone get to act?
- Did the system flow, or did we get stuck on rules?
- What threads are the players most interested in?
- What do I need to prep for next time?

**Prep for session 2:**
- Write the "Previously On" script from your session record
- Note which threads players want to pull
- Prepare 2-3 scenes that advance those threads
- Have one complication ready

**Time needed:** 20-30 minutes

## You've Got This

Hearthfire is designed to be simple. The system stays out of your way. Your job is:
- Frame scenes clearly
- Ask "What do you do?"
- Set Position and Effect
- Keep things moving

The players will do the rest. Trust the fiction. Trust your instincts. When in doubt, make something happen and see how they respond.

Welcome to Hearthfire.

*First sessions are beginnings. They don't need to be perfect. They just need to be inviting enough that everyone wants to come back.*

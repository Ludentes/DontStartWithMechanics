# Hearthfire GM Reference

## Position (How Risky?)

Set this BEFORE the player rolls. Say it out loud.

| Position | On Failure | On Partial |
|----------|------------|------------|
| **Safe** | Nothing bad, just don't succeed | Minor inconvenience |
| **Risky** | Moderate consequence (harm, complication, lost opportunity) | Choose: reduced effect OR consequence |
| **Dangerous** | Severe consequence (serious harm, major setback) | BOTH consequence AND reduced effect |

**Default is Risky.** Use Safe when they have clear advantage. Use Dangerous when they're outmatched or reckless.

---

## Effect (How Much?)

| Effect | On Full Success |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Limited** | Progress, but don't fully resolve |
| **Standard** | Achieve intent as stated |
| **Great** | Achieve intent plus extra benefit |

**Default is Standard.** Limited for tough obstacles or poor positioning. Great when stars align.

## Threat Dial (Combat)

| Threat | Position | Enemy Stress | Purpose |
|--------|----------|--------------|---------|
| **Trivial** | Safe | 2 each | Show competence |
| **Challenging** | Risky | 4 each | Exciting, some cost |
| **Dangerous** | Risky, enemies first | 6 each | Tense, real risk |
| **Desperate** | Dangerous | 8+ each | Survival is victory |

**Damage dealt:**
- Full success = 2 stress
- Partial = 1 stress
- Great effect = +1, Limited = -1

## Scene Pacing

**Target: 4-6 scenes per session**

| Scene Type | Duration | Notes |
|------------|----------|-------|
| Action | 10-15 min | Combat, chase—keep momentum |
| Social | 10-15 min | NPCs have wants |
| Discovery | 10-15 min | Plant clues |
| Character | 5-10 min | Intimate, spotlight one |
| Transition | 3-5 min | Montage it |

**If scene passes 15 minutes:** Look for resolution.
**If scene passes 20 minutes:** Actively wrap it.

## Session Structure

| Phase | Time | What Happens |
|-------|------|--------------|
| **Previously On** | 5-10 min | You recap, players add, each states character detail |
| **The Hook** | 5-10 min | Establish tonight's situation and stakes |
| **The Action** | 60-70 min | 4-6 scenes |
| **Resolution** | 10 min | Climax, wrap episode |
| **Next Time On** | 5 min | Tease, players state intentions, write record |

## NPC Quick-Build

**Name:** _______________

**Role:** What they do (guard, merchant, informant)

**Want:** What they're after right now

**Quirk:** One memorable detail

**If combat:** Threat level → stress boxes

---

## Situation Builder

**Status Quo:** What's happening when players arrive

**Pressure:** Why it can't stay static

**Stakes:** What's at risk / what's available

**Complications (pick if needed):**
- Reinforcements arrive
- Time pressure
- Innocents at risk
- Hidden agenda revealed
- Moral dilemma
- Environment hazard
- Unexpected ally
- Stakes escalate

---

## Compels

When a player's aspect would cause them trouble:

> "Your 'Can't Walk Away From a Fight' means you can't just let this insult slide... right?"

If they accept: Give them 1 Fate Point, the trouble happens.
If they refuse: They pay 1 Fate Point to resist.

**Good compels create drama, not punishment.**

---

## Spotlight Check

Mental checklist—have all players:
- □ Had a moment this session?
- □ Used their character's strengths?
- □ Made a meaningful choice?

If someone's quiet, frame a scene at them:
> "Saren, the merchant looks right at you. 'I know your face. You're the one who...' What does he know?"

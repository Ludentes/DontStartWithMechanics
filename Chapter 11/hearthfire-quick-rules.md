# Hearthfire Quick Rules

## The Core Rule

When you attempt something **uncertain** with **meaningful stakes**, roll dice.

### Building Your Dice Pool

| Source | Dice |
|--------|------|
| Base | 2d6 |
| Approach applies (Bold, Clever, or Swift) | +1d6 |
| Aspect applies | +1d6 |
| Ally assists | +1d6 |
| **Maximum** | **5d6** |

### Reading Results (Highest Die)

| Result | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **6** | **Full Success** — You get what you want |
| **4-5** | **Partial Success** — You get it, but with a cost or complication |
| **1-3** | **Failure** — You don't get it, and face consequences |

## Your Character

### Concept
One sentence describing who you are.

### Aspects (3)
Phrases true about your character. Invoke for +1d6 when relevant.

- **Heroic Drive** — Why you help people
- **Past** — Where you come from
- **Trouble** — What gets you into problems

### Approaches (3)
How you do things. One at +1, one at +1, one at +0.

- **Bold** — Direct action, courage, force, standing firm
- **Clever** — Tricks, plans, knowledge, perception
- **Swift** — Speed, reflexes, stealth, mobility

### Heroic Ability
One special thing you can do **once per session**. When you use it, check the box. It refreshes next session.

### Stress (5 boxes)
Mark when you take harm or push yourself. When all 5 are marked, you're **Taken Out** (unconscious, captured, or forced to flee). Stress clears completely between sessions.

---

## Fate Points

You start each session with **2 Fate Points**.

### Spend 1 to:
- Add **+1d6** to any roll
- **Reroll** all your dice (keep new result)
- **Establish a minor fact** ("There's a chandelier I can swing from, right?")

### Earn 1 by:
- Accepting a **compel** (GM uses your aspect against you)
- Accepting a **complication** that makes your life harder
- Making a **dramatic sacrifice** for the story

---

## Combat

Combat uses the same rules as everything else. There's no initiative—the GM moves the spotlight around the table.

### On Your Turn
1. Describe what you do (fiction first)
2. GM tells you the approach and sets Position/Effect
3. Roll dice
4. GM narrates the outcome

### Stress You Deal
- **Full success:** 2 stress to enemy
- **Partial success:** 1 stress to enemy
- **Great effect:** +1 stress
- **Limited effect:** -1 stress

### Enemy Threat Levels
| Threat | Stress | What It Means |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| Trivial | 2 | Mooks, show off |
| Challenging | 4 | Real fight, you're favored |
| Dangerous | 6 | Serious, could go badly |
| Desperate | 8+ | Survival is victory |

---

## Advancement

At the end of each session, mark **1 advancement tick**.

When you have **3 ticks**, gain an advancement:
- Add a new aspect (max 5)
- Improve an approach: +0→+1 or +1→+2 (max +2)
- Gain a new heroic ability (max 3)
- Earn a narrative reward (title, ally, artifact)

Then clear your ticks and start again.

## The Session Rhythm

1. **Previously On** — GM recaps, you add memories, state one thing about your character
2. **The Hook** — Tonight's situation established
3. **The Action** — Play scenes (4-6 per session)
4. **The Resolution** — Episode wraps up
5. **Next Time On** — GM teases, you state what your character wants next

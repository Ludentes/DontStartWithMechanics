# The Millhaven Situation

*A starting scenario for Hearthfire. Ready for Session 1.*

---

## The Premise

**Millhaven** is a prosperous market town at the edge of the Greywood—an ancient forest that people have learned to respect. For generations, the town and the forest have kept an uneasy peace.

Three weeks ago, that peace broke.

Something is stirring in the Greywood. Livestock vanishes from fields bordering the trees. Hunters who enter don't return. At night, people hear sounds that shouldn't exist—singing that isn't human, laughter from empty darkness.

The town's lord, **Baron Aldworth**, has done nothing. He's sent no soldiers, called no mages, offered no explanation. He's barely left his manor.

The people are afraid. And they're starting to talk about leaving.

**This is where your heroes come in.**

---

## The Hook

Each player character has a connection to Millhaven (established during character creation). Maybe family lives here. Maybe they owe someone in town a debt. Maybe this is the first place that felt like home.

When session 1 begins, the heroes have just arrived—summoned, drawn, or returning. The town is tense. The evening market is half-empty. Guards patrol with nervous eyes.

**The question for session 1:** What's happening in Millhaven, and why won't the Baron act?

## Key NPCs

### Willa Thornwood — The Innkeeper
**Role:** Information broker, concerned citizen
**Want:** To protect her town and her livelihood
**Quirk:** Speaks to everyone like they're old friends, even strangers

Willa runs the **Copper Kettle**, Millhaven's largest inn. She knows everyone and hears everything. She's the first person to approach the heroes—she recognizes capable people when she sees them.

*"You lot look like you can handle yourselves. Good. Because nobody else seems willing to."*

**What she knows:**
- Three hunters entered the Greywood nine days ago. None returned.
- The Baron's steward, Garrett, has been receiving strange shipments at his warehouse. Midnight deliveries. Armed guards.
- Old Maren at the shrine claims she's seen lights in the forest at night. Moving lights, like lanterns carried by no one.

---

### Baron Aldworth — The Silent Lord
**Role:** Absent authority, possible villain or victim
**Want:** Unknown (that's the mystery)
**Quirk:** Once jovial and public; now pale, thin, refuses visitors

The Baron hasn't been seen in public for two weeks. His servants say he's "unwell." His steward handles all business. The town guard answers to the steward now.

**What's actually happening:** The Baron made a deal with something in the Greywood years ago—prosperity for Millhaven in exchange for... something. Now the debt is being called. He's terrified. He's being visited at night by things that come from the forest.

*This is the arc villain situation. The heroes won't learn all this in session 1—but they'll start pulling the thread.*

---

### Garrett — The Steward  
**Role:** Servant of the Baron, intermediary, obstacle
**Want:** To keep the Baron's secret; to protect his position
**Quirk:** Sweats constantly, laughs at inappropriate moments

Garrett is in over his head. He knows something is wrong with the Baron but not the full truth. He's been handling "special arrangements"—the midnight shipments are ritual components, though Garrett doesn't fully understand what they're for.

He will lie. He will obstruct. He's not evil—he's afraid.

*"The Baron is merely ill. These rumors are peasant superstition. I must ask you to leave."*

---

### Old Maren — The Shrine Keeper
**Role:** Exposition, spiritual guidance, possible ally
**Want:** To protect Millhaven from what's coming
**Quirk:** Speaks in half-riddles; always seems to know more than she says

Maren tends the shrine to the old forest spirits at the town's edge. She remembers the old stories. She knows what walks in the Greywood.

*"The forest doesn't forget, child. And it doesn't forgive. Someone made a promise, long ago. Promises must be kept."*

**What she knows:**
- The Greywood is home to the Thornkin—spirits of the forest, neither good nor evil, but bound by old bargains
- The Baron's family made a pact three generations ago
- The lights in the forest are the Thornkin gathering; something has awakened them

---

### Captain Reeve — The Guard Captain
**Role:** Potential ally, conflicted authority
**Want:** To do his job, even if his orders make no sense
**Quirk:** Chews a wooden coin when nervous (he's always chewing it now)

Reeve is a good soldier stuck in an impossible situation. His orders are to maintain peace and keep people away from the manor and the forest. He doesn't know why. He doesn't like it.

If the heroes earn his trust, he'll bend the rules. If they make him look bad, he'll be an obstacle.

*"I don't know what's happening, and that's the truth. But my orders are clear. Stay away from the Greywood."*

---

## Locations

### The Copper Kettle
Millhaven's inn. Warm, busy, the center of gossip. Willa runs it with her two sons. Good food, strong ale, clean beds. This is where the heroes will likely stay and where they'll gather information.

### The Baron's Manor
Stone walls, iron gates, guards who turn visitors away. The Baron hasn't been seen. Lights burn in his study through the night. Getting inside is a challenge—but the answers are in there.

### Garrett's Warehouse  
Near the docks. Receives shipments at midnight. Guarded by hired thugs, not town guards. What's inside? Ritual components—salt, silver, black candles, and something in a locked iron box that hums faintly.

### The Shrine of Green Silence
At the forest's edge. Stone altar, old carvings of faces that might be human. Maren lives in a cottage beside it. The air here feels heavy. Watched.

### The Greywood
Ancient forest. Dark even at midday. No one goes in anymore. Those who do hear things—whispers, footsteps that match their own, laughter. The deeper you go, the stranger it gets.

## Session 1: Episode Structure

### Previously On
*Skip for session 1—this is where you start.*

### The Hook (10 minutes)
Heroes arrive in Millhaven. Evening. The market is closing early; people are nervous. A child runs past crying about "the sounds last night."

Willa approaches them at the Copper Kettle. She sizes them up. She offers a free meal if they'll listen to what's been happening.

### The Action (60-70 minutes)

**Scene 1: The Copper Kettle (Social)**
Willa tells them what she knows. Other patrons chime in with rumors—some true, some exaggerated. The heroes learn about the missing hunters, the Baron's seclusion, and Garrett's strange shipments.

*Stakes:* What threads do they pull first?

**Scene 2: Investigation (Discovery)**
Let players choose their approach:
- **Talk to Maren** — Learn about the old pact and the Thornkin
- **Scout the warehouse** — See the guards, maybe spot a shipment
- **Approach the manor** — Get turned away, but learn the guards are nervous
- **Talk to Captain Reeve** — Get the official line, maybe sense his doubt

Run whichever they choose. One scene, 10-15 minutes.

**Scene 3: Complication (Action or Social)**
Something forces their hand:
- If they scouted the warehouse: They're spotted. Chase or confrontation.
- If they talked to Maren: Something moves in the trees nearby. Watching.
- If they approached the manor: A servant slips them a note—"Help us. Midnight. Servant's entrance."
- If they talked to Reeve: A hunter stumbles out of the forest, babbling, clawed by something.

This creates urgency and leads to:

**Scene 4: Escalation (Action)**
The episode's climax. Options:
- **Warehouse confrontation** — The test scene we ran. Discover the ritual components.
- **Forest edge encounter** — Something from the Greywood makes contact—a Thornkin, beautiful and terrible, delivering a warning.
- **Manor infiltration** — Sneak in, find the Baron in his study, see what he's become (gaunt, terrified, surrounded by protective sigils).

### Resolution (10 minutes)
The heroes have learned something—not the whole truth, but a thread to pull. They know:
- Something is wrong with the Baron
- The Greywood is waking up
- Someone in town is preparing for something

They haven't solved it. They've started.

### Next Time On (5 minutes)
GM teases: *"Next time: the midnight meeting at the manor. The truth about the Baron's bargain. And something in the forest that knows your names."*

Each player states what their character wants to do next.

Write the session record.

## The Arc (Sessions 1-4)

**Session 1:** Arrival, investigation, first confrontation. Learn something is wrong.

**Session 2:** Deeper investigation. Learn about the pact. Meet a Thornkin. The Baron's situation becomes clearer—he's a victim as much as a cause.

**Session 3:** The debt comes due. The Thornkin make their move. The heroes must choose: honor the old pact (sacrifice), break the pact (war with the forest), or find a third way.

**Session 4:** Climax. Confront the consequence of their choice. Resolve the Millhaven situation—for now. Establish new status quo.

---

## Complications Menu

If you need to add drama:
- A Thornkin appears and speaks in riddles
- Garrett's thugs try to run the heroes out of town
- A townsperson goes missing
- The Baron escapes his manor, found wandering toward the forest
- Maren reveals she knows one of the heroes' parents
- The shipments include something alive—barely

---

## The Thornkin

*The forest's children. Neither good nor evil. Old.*

**Appearance:** Almost human. Too tall, too still, skin like bark or moss, eyes like lanterns. Beautiful in a way that unsettles.

**Nature:** They are the Greywood. They made a pact with the Baron's grandfather: prosperity for Millhaven, in exchange for a bride from the Baron's line. For three generations, the family has avoided paying. The Thornkin are patient. But not forever.

**What they want:** The bargain honored. Or the bargain broken openly, which frees them to act.

**What they'll do:** Watch. Test. Speak in terms the heroes might not understand. They're not villains—they're creditors. They can be reasoned with. But they cannot be cheated.

**In combat (Dangerous threat):**
- Stress: 6
- Special: Can step into one tree and out of another. Can speak without sound—only the target hears.

*Millhaven awaits. The forest watches. The story begins.*

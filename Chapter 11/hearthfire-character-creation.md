# Hearthfire Character Creation

*Make a hero in 20-30 minutes.*

---

## Before You Begin

Character creation in Hearthfire is collaborative. You're not just making a character—you're making a character who fits the game and connects to the other players.

**What you need:**
- A blank character card
- The other players
- The GM's campaign premise

**What the GM provides first:**
- The premise (what's this campaign about?)
- The tone (heroic? gritty? hopeful?)
- The hook (what situation are you walking into?)

Don't start creating until you've heard this.

---

## Step 1: Concept (2 minutes)

Complete this sentence:

> **"I am a _____________ who _____________."**

The first blank is what you are. The second is what drives you or makes you distinctive.

**Examples:**
- "I am a *wandering knight* who *seeks redemption for failing my homeland*."
- "I am a *village healer* who *discovered dangerous magic in my bloodline*."
- "I am a *former thief* who *now uses my skills to protect the innocent*."

**The Filter:** Does this concept fit heroic fantasy where characters help people? If your concept is "a mercenary who only cares about gold," pause. Can it be reframed? "A mercenary who *discovered some things matter more than gold*" works.

Write your concept on your character card.

---

## Step 2: Heroic Drive (1 minute)

Why do you do good? Pick one:

| Drive | What It Means |
|-------|---------------|
| **Justice** | You right wrongs and protect the innocent |
| **Redemption** | You atone for past failures by doing good now |
| **Glory** | You seek to become legendary through great deeds |
| **Duty** | You serve a cause, order, or people greater than yourself |
| **Hope** | You believe the world can be better and fight to make it so |
| **Love** | You protect those you care about; your bonds give you strength |

This becomes your first Aspect: **"Driven by [your choice]"**

Write it in the first aspect slot.

---

## Step 3: Two More Aspects (5 minutes)

Aspects are phrases that are true about your character. They can be invoked for +1d6 when relevant. They can also be compelled to create complications (earning you Fate Points).

### Your Past

Complete: **"I was/am a _____________ from _____________."**

This is where you come from—your training, your origins, your history.

**Examples:**
- "Knight of the Silver Dawn"
- "Survivor of the Burning Village"
- "Scholar of Forbidden Texts"
- "Child of the Wild Forests"

### Your Trouble

Complete: **"I can't resist _____________"** or **"I struggle with _____________"** or **"_____________ haunts me."**

This is what gets you into problems. Good troubles create interesting situations without destroying the party.

**Good troubles:**
- "Can't Walk Away From a Fight"
- "The Duke's Men Are Still Looking for Me"
- "Haunted by What I Did"
- "I See the Good in Everyone (Even When I Shouldn't)"

**Bad troubles (avoid these):**
- "I betray my friends for gold" (breaks party trust)
- "I'm secretly evil" (wrong game)
- "I don't care about anything" (no hooks)

Write your Past and Trouble in the aspect slots.

## Step 4: Approaches (1 minute)

How do you solve problems? Distribute +1, +1, and +0 among:

| Approach | What It Covers |
|----------|----------------|
| **Bold** | Direct action, courage, force, standing firm, intimidation |
| **Clever** | Tricks, plans, knowledge, perception, persuasion, deception |
| **Swift** | Speed, reflexes, stealth, mobility, quick reactions |

**Think about your concept:**
- A warrior? Probably Bold +1, Swift +1, Clever +0
- A scholar? Probably Clever +1, Swift +1, Bold +0
- A rogue? Probably Swift +1, Clever +1, Bold +0

There's no wrong answer. This is about how your character *tends* to approach things.

Mark your ratings on the character card.

---

## Step 5: Heroic Ability (3 minutes)

Choose one special thing you can do **once per session**. When you use it, mark it used. It refreshes at the start of each session.

### Combat Abilities
- **Battle Fury:** Automatically succeed on one combat roll. No roll needed—you just do it.
- **Shield of the Innocent:** When an ally within reach would take stress, take it yourself instead.
- **Whirlwind Strike:** One attack affects all enemies engaged with you.

### Social Abilities
- **Voice of Truth:** Compel one NPC to answer a question honestly.
- **Inspiring Words:** Clear 2 stress from an ally through encouragement.
- **Reputation Precedes Me:** NPCs recognize you; adjust their disposition one step favorable.

### Utility Abilities
- **Ancient Lore:** Ask the GM one question about history, magic, or the world. Get a true answer.
- **Uncanny Senses:** Automatically notice one hidden thing in a scene.
- **Lucky Break:** Declare a convenient coincidence ("There's a back door, right?"). GM may adjust for plausibility.

### Create Your Own
If none of these fit, propose something to the GM:
- What does it do?
- How often? (Once per session is standard)
- Does it auto-succeed, or does it enhance a roll?

Write your Heroic Ability on the card.

## Step 6: Connections (5 minutes)

This is the most important step. Isolated characters with no ties make for weak stories.

### Connections to the Party

For each other player character, establish one of:
- How you know each other
- Why you trust them
- A shared memory

**Go around the table.** Each pair of players creates one connection.

**Examples:**
- "Kira saved my life at the Battle of Thornfield. I owe her."
- "Marcus and I trained together. He was always the smarter one."
- "I don't trust easily, but Saren... Saren I trust."

Write the names and connections on your card.

### Connection to the World

Establish one of:
- A place you care about (home, sanctuary, somewhere meaningful)
- A person you care about (family, mentor, friend—NOT a party member)
- A group you belong to or feel loyalty toward

Give the GM a name and a sentence.

**Examples:**
- "My mother Elara still lives in Millhaven."
- "I still carry the badge of the Order of the Silver Dawn."
- "The orphans of Thornfield—I send them what I can."

This is GM content. Everything you care about is something the story can use.

### Connection to the Hook

The GM has told you the starting situation. Why can't your character walk away?

**Examples:**
- "My mother lives in Millhaven. I won't let anything happen to her."
- "What's in the Greywood... it feels like what destroyed my homeland."
- "I was a coward once. People died because I ran. Never again."

This ensures your character is invested in the story. "I don't care about any of this" is not a valid answer—if you don't care, make a character who does.

---

## Step 7: Final Check (2 minutes)

Go around the table. Each player states:
- Character concept (one sentence)
- Heroic drive (one word)
- Why they're here (one sentence)

Does everyone fit? Does anyone feel like they're in a different story? Address mismatches now, not three sessions in.

---

## The Complete Character Card

When you're done, your card should have:

**Front:**
- Name
- Concept (one sentence)
- Three Aspects (Drive, Past, Trouble)
- Three Approaches with ratings
- Heroic Ability

**Back:**
- Stress boxes (5, empty)
- Fate Point tracker (start with 2)
- Connections (party, world, hook)
- Advancement tracker

**That's your character.** Everything you need fits on one card.

---

## Quick Creation (10 minutes)

If you're short on time, use pre-generated characters and just personalize:

1. Pick a pre-gen
2. Fill in the name and blanks
3. Establish party connections (one per pair of players)
4. State your hook connection
5. Play

This gets you to the game in 10 minutes with characters that feel yours.

---

## Character Growth

Characters advance through play:
- Mark 1 tick at the end of each session
- 3 ticks = 1 advancement
- Advancement options:
  - New aspect (max 5 total)
  - Improve approach (+0→+1 or +1→+2, max +2)
  - New heroic ability (max 3 total)
  - Narrative reward (title, land, ally, artifact)

At monthly sessions, you'll advance roughly once per quarter. It's slow but meaningful.

*Your character is ready. The fire is lit. The story begins.*

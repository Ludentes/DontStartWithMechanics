*A complete scene showing how the game flows.*

---

## Setup

**The situation:** The heroes are in Millhaven, investigating strange happenings. They've learned that Garrett, the Baron's steward, has been receiving midnight shipments at his warehouse. They've decided to investigate.

**Characters:**
- **Kira** (the Wanderer) — Bold +1, Swift +1, Aspect: "Can't Walk Away From a Fight"
- **Marcus** (the Scholar) — Clever +1, Swift +1, Aspect: "Haunted by What I Learned"
- **Saren** (the Scoundrel) — Clever +1, Swift +1, Aspect: "Ghost of the Riverside Slums"

Each has 2 Fate Points and empty stress tracks.

## The Scene: The Warehouse

### Scene Frame

**GM:** "It's nearly midnight. You're in the alley behind Garrett's warehouse—the building the innkeeper told you was receiving strange deliveries. There's a service door on this side and a high window with dim light behind it. The street is quiet. What's your approach?"

*[The GM has established: location, what's visible, the relevant detail (the door and window), and handed off to the players.]*

---

### Saren Checks the Door

**Saren's player:** "I want to check that door. Test the handle gently, listen for anyone inside."

**GM:** "That's Clever—perception and caution. Let's say **Risky position, Standard effect**. If you succeed, you know what you're dealing with. If things go wrong, someone might hear you."

**Saren's player:** "Can I invoke 'Ghost of the Riverside Slums'? I grew up breaking into places."

**GM:** "Absolutely."

*[Saren builds dice pool: 2d6 base + 1d6 Clever + 1d6 Aspect = 4d6]*

**Saren's player:** *[Rolls 4d6: 2, 3, 3, 5]* "Highest is 5. Partial success."

**GM:** "The handle turns—it's unlocked, which is suspicious. You hear voices inside, at least two men, sounds like they're playing cards. But as you lean in to listen, your boot scrapes on a loose cobblestone. The voices stop. 'Did you hear that?' One of them is coming to check."

*[Partial success: Saren got the information (door unlocked, people inside) but with a complication (they heard him).]*

**GM:** "You've got maybe five seconds. What do you do?"

---

### Kira Acts

**Kira's player:** "I flatten against the wall by the door. When he opens it, I grab him and pull him into the alley before he can shout."

**GM:** "That's Bold. He's alert but not expecting violence. **Risky position, Standard effect.** Full success means you get him silently. Partial means you grab him but there's noise. Failure means he shouts."

*[Kira builds pool: 2d6 base + 1d6 Bold = 3d6]*

**Kira's player:** *[Rolls 3d6: 1, 2, 3]* "...Three. Failure."

**GM:** "The door swings open. You grab for him—but he's faster than you expected, already suspicious. He jerks back, your fingers catch his collar but he tears free and shouts 'INTRUDERS!' before you can silence him. Chairs scrape inside. So much for stealth."

*[Failure at Risky position: the consequence happens—he alerts his friends.]*

---

### Combat Begins

**GM:** "Two men burst through the door. The one you grabbed is stumbling back, drawing a cudgel. His partner has a short sword. They're hired muscle—not soldiers, but they've been in scraps. From deeper in the warehouse, you hear more footsteps. Maybe a minute before reinforcements."

**GM:** "This is a **Challenging** fight—Risky position to start."

*[GM establishes threat level, which determines enemy stress and starting position.]*

**Enemies:**
- Thug 1 (cudgel): 4 stress
- Thug 2 (sword): 4 stress

---

### Round 1

**GM:** "Kira, you're right at the door. One's in your face. What do you do?"

**Kira's player:** "I draw my blade and drive him back. 'You should have stayed inside.'"

**GM:** "Bold. Risky position, Standard effect. Roll it."

*[3d6: Bold]*

**Kira's player:** *[Rolls: 3, 4, 6]* "Six! Full success."

**GM:** "Your sword clears the scabbard and you're on him. The cudgel goes wide, your blade opens his arm, and you shoulder-check him into his partner. They crash together."

*[Full success at Standard effect = 2 stress to Thug 1]*

**Thug 1:** ■ ■ □ □

---

**GM:** "Marcus, they're tangled up. What are you doing?"

**Marcus's player:** "There are crates by the door, right? I want to shove them into the fight—keep them off-balance, create chaos."

**GM:** "Clever—using the environment. They're already stumbling, so I'll say **Great effect**. Still Risky. If this works, you'll make everyone's life easier."

*[3d6: Clever]*

**Marcus's player:** *[Rolls: 2, 5, 5]* "Five. Partial."

**GM:** "Crates tumble—one thug dodges, the other takes one to the legs. But the crash is LOUD. Reinforcements are coming faster. Your choice: the crates helped but the timeline's accelerated, OR the crates didn't help much but the noise wasn't so bad."

**Marcus's player:** "The crates helped. We need to end this fast anyway."

*[Partial success with choice: player picks which cost to take.]*

**Thug 2:** ■ □ □ □ (1 stress from crates, plus prone)

---

**GM:** "Saren, the swordsman is down in debris. The other is bleeding but up, facing Kira."

**Saren's player:** "Knife out. I'm going for the one on the ground before he recovers. Swift—I'm fast."

**GM:** "He's prone and tangled. **Safe position, Standard effect.** Even if you miss, he can't reach you from there."

*[3d6: Swift]*

**Saren's player:** *[Rolls: 1, 4, 6]* "Six!"

**GM:** "He's pushing a crate off his legs when your knife finds the gap in his jerkin. He gasps, goes limp."

*[Full success = 2 stress. Thug 2 now has 3 stress total. At 4, he's done—close enough, GM rules he's out.]*

**Thug 2:** ■ ■ ■ ■ — Defeated

**GM:** "He's done—unconscious or surrendering?"

**Saren's player:** "Unconscious. Cleaner."

---

### Round 2

**GM:** "One down, one up. Kira, the cudgel guy swings at you—"

**Kira's player:** "I want to end this. Can I invoke 'Blade of the Fallen Legion'? My old unit was brutal and efficient."

**GM:** "Perfect."

*[4d6: Bold + Aspect]*

**Kira's player:** *[Rolls: 2, 3, 4, 4]* "Four. Partial."

**GM:** "You beat his guard down, blade bites deep—he crumples. But his cudgel clips your ribs on the way down. Take 1 stress."

*[Partial: success with cost. Thug 1 takes 2 stress (now 4, defeated), but Kira takes 1 stress.]*

**Kira:** ■ □ □ □ □

**Thug 1:** ■ ■ ■ ■ — Defeated

---

### Combat Ends

**GM:** "Both down. But you hear boots—more coming from inside. Maybe thirty seconds. The doorway's clear. What do you do?"

**Marcus's player:** "Is there anything visible? Crates, papers, anything?"

**GM:** "The crates you knocked over have spilled—straw packing, and something metallic glinting."

**Saren's player:** "I grab whatever's glinting. Look at it later."

**GM:** "Quick action, no roll—you snatch it. It's a medallion, black metal, oddly warm."

**Kira's player:** "We go. Out the way we came."

**GM:** "You slip into the alley as shouts erupt behind you. By the time they reach the door, you're shadows. Scene."

## What Just Happened

**Scene duration:** This would run about 12-15 minutes at the table.

**Rolls made:** 5 total
- 1 partial (Saren checking door) — information with complication
- 1 failure (Kira grabbing guard) — triggered combat
- 1 full success (Kira attacking) — clean hit
- 1 partial (Marcus with crates) — help with cost
- 1 full success (Saren finishing enemy)
- 1 partial (Kira finishing fight) — win with cost

**Resources used:**
- 2 aspect invocations (Saren's Slums, Kira's Legion)
- 0 Fate Points spent
- 1 stress taken (Kira)

**GM techniques demonstrated:**
- Clear scene framing
- Position/Effect stated before every roll
- Partial successes driving drama (the best moments came from complications)
- Spotlight rotation (each player acted roughly equally)
- Time pressure creating urgency without mechanics
- Ending on forward momentum

## Key Takeaways

**Fiction first:** Players describe what they do in the world. The GM translates to approaches and sets stakes. Rolls happen when needed.

**Three-tier results create story:** Full success is clean. Failure creates problems. But partial success—where you get what you want AND face a complication—drives the most interesting moments.

**Combat is fast:** Two enemies with 4 stress each. Fight lasted 2 "rounds" (spotlight rotations). Total time: ~10 minutes.

**GM judgment is transparent:** Every roll had Position and Effect stated before dice were picked up. Players always knew the stakes.

**Momentum matters:** The scene never stalled. When one thing resolved, the GM immediately established the next situation. "What do you do?" kept things moving.

## The Hearthfire Promise

This game is designed for:
- **Busy adults** who can only meet monthly
- **2-hour sessions** that feel complete
- **4-6 week gaps** that don't kill the story
- **Minimal prep** for players and GM
- **Rules that disappear** during play

If the system ever gets in the way of the story, trust the fiction and move on.

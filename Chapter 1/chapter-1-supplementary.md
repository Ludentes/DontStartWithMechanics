## Aesthetic Quick Reference

### Activity-Based Aesthetics

| Aesthetic | Core Experience | Key Examples | Design Requirement |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Challenge | Overcoming obstacles through skill | *Celeste*, *Wordle*, *Portal* | Clear success/failure, learnable patterns |
| Discovery | Finding secrets, uncovering knowledge | *Outer Wilds*, *Obra Dinn*, *BotW* | Hidden content, revelation moments |
| Mastery | Deep system understanding over time | *Street Fighter*, *Path of Exile*, *Factorio* | Depth, optimization space, skill ceiling |
| Expression | Creating and showing personal vision | *Minecraft*, *The Sims*, *Dreams* | Possibility space, meaningful choices |
| Fellowship | Social connection and collaboration | *It Takes Two*, *Among Us*, *Animal Crossing* | Multiplayer, shared experience |
| Submission | Relaxation, flow state | *Stardew Valley*, *Euro Truck Sim*, *Cookie Clicker* | Low pressure, comfortable rhythm |
| Progression | Growing stronger over time | *Diablo*, *Hades*, *Vampire Survivors* | Visible advancement, power growth |

### Emotion-Based Aesthetics

| Aesthetic | Core Experience | Key Examples | Design Requirement |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Tension | Pressure, stakes, danger | *XCOM*, *Dead Cells*, *Darkest Dungeon* | Consequences, time pressure, uncertainty |
| Wonder | Awe and beauty | *Journey*, *Ori*, *Shadow of the Colossus* | Visual/audio beauty, transcendent moments |
| Competition | Testing against others | *Rocket League*, *Counter-Strike*, *Chess* | Skill differentiation, legible comparison |

### Specialized Aesthetics

| Aesthetic | Core Experience | Key Examples | When to Define |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|----------------|
| Horror | Dread, fear, vulnerability | *Amnesia*, *Resident Evil* | "Tense Discovery" doesn't capture it |
| Grief | Processing loss, moral weight | *This War of Mine*, *Spiritfarer* | Emotional depth beyond Narrative |
| Roleplay | Inhabiting specific role | Farming sims, submarine sims | The role itself is the appeal |

## Player Investment Profiles

### Casual Players

**Capacity:**
- Time: 5-30 minutes per session
- Cognitive load: 3-5 simultaneous elements
- Context: Mobile, browsers, interruption-prone
- Session gaps: Hours to days
- Mental model persistence: Low (decays between sessions)

**Accessible aesthetics:** Submission, simple Fellowship, fast Progression, session-contained Challenge, Wonder

**Inaccessible aesthetics:** Mastery, complex Narrative, sustained Tension

**Design requirements:**
- Meso loops complete within session (5-15 minutes)
- No assumed continuity between sessions
- Save anywhere, tutorial in 60 seconds
- Never punish gaps

### Midcore Players

**Capacity:**
- Time: 30-90 minutes per session
- Cognitive load: 5-7 simultaneous systems
- Context: Dedicated device with focus time
- Session gaps: Days to weeks
- Mental model persistence: Moderate (needs reminders)

**Accessible aesthetics:** All, with appropriate scaffolding

**Design requirements:**
- Macro loops complete within session (30-60 minutes)
- Session recaps essential
- Tutorials spread across 2-5 sessions
- Meta loops must survive week-long gaps
- "Rusty player" accommodation

### Hardcore Players

**Capacity:**
- Time: 2+ hours per session, multiple times per week
- Cognitive load: High tolerance (complex systems welcome)
- Context: Dedicated setup, uninterrupted time
- Session gaps: Hours to days (active engagement)
- Mental model persistence: High (maintains indefinitely)

**Accessible aesthetics:** All, but specifically seeks Mastery, high Challenge, Competition

**Design requirements:**
- Depth at all loop scales
- Skill ceilings that take hundreds of hours
- Emergent complexity from system interaction
- Optimization opportunities
- Community/wiki support assumed

### Busy Adults

**Capacity:**
- Time: 30-60 minutes per session (irregular)
- Cognitive load: High capacity, low availability
- Context: Experienced gamer with life constraints
- Session gaps: Days to weeks (unpredictable)
- Mental model persistence: High if reminded

**Wants:** Hardcore depth with casual availability

**Design requirements:**
- Aggressive session recaps
- Pause/save anywhere
- Meaningful progress in 30 minutes
- Journals, quest logs, encyclopedias
- Scalable difficulty
- No grinding, no time-gating

## System Functions Reference

| Function | What It Does | Speed by Loop Scale | Aesthetic Considerations |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Adjudication | Resolves "what happens?" | Micro: instant; Meso: seconds; Macro: minutes | Challenge needs consistency; Narrative needs flexibility |
| Information Management | Controls what players know | Most critical at meso scale | Discovery: info is reward; Horror: info is unreliable |
| Content Generation | Creates variety | Meso: 10-20 iterations without repetition | Authored vs. procedural vs. hybrid |
| State Persistence | Maintains continuity | Match to investment profile | Casual: simple; Hardcore: complex |
| Feedback Systems | Communicates outcomes | Clear enables learning; obscured creates mystery | Match density to loop speed |
| Cognitive Framing | Shapes interpretation | Implicit but powerful | Same mechanics feel different with different framing |

## Configuration Coherence Checklist

For each component, ask: "Does this serve my primary aesthetic?"

| Component | Question | Red Flag |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Mechanics | Do actions support the intended experience? | Random success in skill-testing game |
| Parameters | Do numbers create the right feel? | Trivial failure in Challenge game |
| Context | Does meaning reinforce mechanics? | Serious tone with silly mechanics |
| Temporal Structure | Do loops match aesthetic needs? | Long micro loops in flow-seeking game |
| Configuration | Do all components point the same direction? | Components fighting each other |
